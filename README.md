# Owlbear's Tracks for blendOS

These are my personal Tracks for blendOS. This includes the basic tracks from the original blendOS repo that I'm keeping for reference, minus the ones I just ain't gonna use. The originals here are:

* **blendOS Base**: blendos-base
* * The base track others are based on. I'm going to use this as a basis for Owlbear-Core
* **Gnome**: `gnome`
* * The base Gnome track, which I will be streamlining to make Gnomeish-Owlbear

And that's it for now. I might add an XFCE one or a more customized one if I get ambitious.

## Owlbear's Custom Tracks

These are the ones I'm building for myself, because blendOS's system.yaml thing is kinda fun, and I want  to learn more. 

* **Owlbear Core**: 'owlbear-core'
* *The baseline that the other stuff is built off of, a modified version of blendos-base, but with the fish shell and a few other changes.
